# StoreMDB
Node.js Backend: You are using Node.js as the backend technology to handle server-side logic, API routes, and interactions with the database.

MongoDB Database: MongoDB is your chosen database system for storing and managing data related to the storage management system.

QuaggaJS or ZXing: You are integrating barcode scanning functionality into the system, which allows users to scan barcodes using their devices' cameras and extract information from them.

Express.js: You are using Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js, to build your API routes and serve your frontend files.

Angular or AngularJS: You have mentioned both Angular and AngularJS in your questions, indicating that you are using one of these frameworks for your frontend. Angular is a modern and robust framework for building dynamic web applications, while AngularJS (also known as Angular 1) is an older version of the framework.

Prisma.IO: You have mentioned Prisma.IO, which is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that helps you work with databases more easily by providing a type-safe and intuitive way to interact with the database using code.

Storage Management Functionality: Your application likely includes features related to managing items, assets, or products stored in a storage facility. This could involve scanning barcodes, retrieving item information from the database, adding new items, updating item details, and more.

Communication Between Components: You are using routing and possibly services to facilitate communication between different components of your application. This involves passing data between components, fetching data from the backend, and updating the user interface based on retrieved data.

User Interface: Your application's user interface is likely composed of HTML, CSS, and possibly additional frontend frameworks like Bootstrap or Material Design to create a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

In summary, your project aims to create a storage management system that utilizes Node.js, MongoDB, barcode scanning technology, and frontend frameworks like Angular or AngularJS. You are implementing functionalities for scanning barcodes, querying a database, displaying retrieved information, and managing the user interface. The use of Prisma.IO enhances the database interaction process. The project involves backend and frontend development, data management, and user interface design.
